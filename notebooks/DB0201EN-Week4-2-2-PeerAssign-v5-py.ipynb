    "To complete the assignment problems in this notebook you will be using three datasets that are available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal:\n",
    "1. <a href=\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2\">Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago</a>\n",
